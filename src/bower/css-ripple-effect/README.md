# Pure CSS ripple effect (no JavaScript)

## CSS-only implementation of Android Material design "ripple" animation on click event

Main advantage of this solution is that there is no DOM manipulation in order to create animation. That means this is faster - it doesn't use JavaScript or jQuery to animate.

This solution is also implemented in one of the biggest Bootstrap theming libraries [Bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com/) in their [Materia theme](https://bootswatch.com/materia/#buttons).

Installation
============

This library can be installed via `bower`

```
bower install css-ripple-effect --save
```

Or you can use `npm`

```
npm install css-ripple-effect --save
```

Or you can simply download it in your project, but that way you don't have the option to update if newer versions appear.
